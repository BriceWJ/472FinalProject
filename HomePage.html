    <h1>GEOB 472 Class Mapped Out</h1>

    <p>

With Covid-19 having “alarming implications for individual and collective health and emotional and social functioning” (Pfefferbaum, 2021) we thought it important to try and connect with others in a fun and interactive way. Covid has been hard on many people worldwide, and students are feeling the pressure and isolation. With virtual classes it became harder to interact with and get to know fellow students in class. For such reasons, our team decided to make a map that brought the class together in a virtual way. The hope for this map was that it could bring students together during a time when we were all isolated. Our goals were to visualize the ways in which everyone in the GEOB 472 class at the University of British Columbia are connected, and what similarities we share. Additionally, we wanted to uncover trends in the information that we collected and find ways to visualize it cartographically.
</p>
<p>
	    To obtain the data used to make the project, we created a survey and distributed it amongst the class for people to answer. The questions asked were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Nickname/Alias
</li>
<li>
Where are you from?
</li>
<li>
What is your major?
</li>
<li>
Where do you currently live?
</li>
<li>
Where do you want to visit/travel to? (top three)
</li>
<li>
Where is your favorite place to spend time in Vancouver?
</li>
<li>
What is your favorite place or a place you find interesting/cool?
</li>
<li>
What is your favourite museum?
</li>
<li>
What is your favourite sports team and their city/state/province/country?
</li>
<li>
Your favorite hike or trail?
</li>
<li>
What countries have you visited/been too?
</li>
<li>
Additional Information
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These questions were designed to help the class get to know about each other more by representing the answers to these questions cartographically. It also guided our decision-making processes in how we wanted to represent these relationships. Once we had obtained a good number of responses, we categorized the data into three groups. The first being where people are from and where they live now. The second being points of interest like museums and favourite places. The third being countries people have been to and the ones they want to visit. When going through the data it was determined that while we asked about people’s favourite sports team, this data did not match as well with the categories we had created and so this data was left out of the final product.
</p>
  <p>
	   The final product was the GEOB 472 class represented cartographically. As many students have been feeling isolated during this pandemic (Laskowski, 2020) and most courses have been moved online, the day-to-day reality of students has shifted. For this reason, we thought it would be interesting to show where we are all from in this class and where we all are now. The result of this project were three different maps that demonstrated the uniqueness of every participant, while also highlighting each person’s mobility and experiences.
</p>
<p>
	    The data collected for this project connects the past, the future, and the present. It portrays where people are currently, where they want to travel to, and their current interests. These are all variables that can change over time. Much of this project is temporary, and reflects the current state of things; but people’s locations and interests change, and mobility is a large factor in today’s society. Therefore, this map can take many different shapes as time goes on and more data is collected.  The subjectiveness to the present allows for openness and new opportunities. As Sebastien Coquard states; “These numerous relationships between maps and narratives indicate the importance of spatiality in the arts and the social sciences” (2011, p.135). We have included data that represents the individuality and interconnectedness of each person in the class. Furthermore, we demonstrated a relationship between each person and place.

    <p>
This first map situates the audience within the context of our project. It marks the beginning of our narrative since it represents mobility and interconnectedness of our individual stories. It also sets the tone for the formation of the experiences we have had in different spaces and provides the context to add meaning behind the narration of who each person is. The multiple, smooth lines allow for the audience to visualize our paths to the present. It ties together both past and present, while also shifting the idea of place to space once we learn more about each individual.
</p>

<P>
We live in a world where mobility is facilitated through travel; therefore, experiences are dispersed around the globe. We represent a unique data set since every individual is from somewhere different, yet we have at least one place in common. The animation of the plane moving along the smooth line adds movement and direction to the map which brings it to life.

    <p>
      This map moves from the past to the future by demonstrating the places that people have been, to the places where they would like to travel to. It tells the story of both time and space.  Caquard (2011) explains how cartographic stories are created through the connection of experiences and understanding to different places on a map (p.136). The information depicted in this map represents both similar and differentiating interests of new places to explore. It also maps the past and future movements which demonstrates how people’s spatial positioning continues to change over time. This is representative of how much movement people have been able to do, and how much they still want to.
    </p>

    <p>
Place is represented spatially and temporarily since this map highlights both places that have been travelled to, and places that people desire to travel to. It highlights common interests with the use of darker shades to represent the areas that are more popular among our group .Each place that is identified in color is connected to an experience and a relationship between a person and place; therefore, building a story.

     The focus of this last map delves deeper into the concept of place. The different symbols direct the audience towards different places that represent a point of interest that is connected to each individual in the class. Each symbol represents either an individual's favorite museum, favorite place in Vancouver, favorite place in the world, or favorite hike or trail. Margaret Wickens Pearce (2008) explains how narrative maps make use of symbols as a form of cartographic language for the audience. The article explains that symbols are effective in organizing structures, creating visual hierarchy, and representing experience (p.19-20). Our goal for this map was to represent these interests cartographically and narrate the meaning of space on a larger scale. The mobility and trajectories portrayed in the following maps build the foundation for the meaning that is represented in each point of interest. The points are scattered around the world. We included a specific question for our favorite places in Vancouver since it is the place we have in common. Otherwise the museums, hikes, and favorite places are scattered around the globe which demonstrates the uniqueness of each person when featured alongside each other.
</p>

<p>
As Caquard (2011) explains, cartography today applies many different mediums and techniques to represent social and spatial relationships. For instance, we used grid maps for navigational purposes and to build the setting for the audience as our ‘base map’. However, the layers that we added afterwards for each separate categorization added data to depict the story that we want to tell. Edward Segal and Jeffrey Heer (2010) analyze different design strategies of narrative visualization. For our maps, we used a “details on demand” strategy by integrating mouseover effects over points or countries in Map #2 and Map #3 respectively. The data is then represented in the box in the corner of the map to provide the audience with the information connected with that place. Furthermore, we added a search bar to the map to facilitate the retrieval of information. Thus, the interactivity is in the hands of the audience but our features are there to guide them. Map #1 used an “animated transition” strategy through the use of airplanes over the smooth lines that can be replayed on demand. The motion takes the audience from one point on the map representing where the individual is from to where they are living now. Overall, each map is representative of a “single-frame interactivity strategy” which means that the interactivity occurs within the single frame without transporting the audience to another scene (Segel & Heer, 2010). This is effective in allowing the audience to explore all the data within one frame, and allows us to guide their focus to the important information. Although, the maps tell a story when put in context to each other.

<p>
Narrative maps can be shaped in various ways using the programming tools that we have today, along with different design strategies and techniques. Our goal for this project was to visualize data from our classmates on three different maps. We wanted to illustrate mobility, connectivity and the meaning of place in our maps. Together, our maps take the audience through experiences from the past and present, while creating a story for the future. Through different cartographic methods, we aimed to transform the idea of place to space where meaning is held. Our maps took the perception of one small classroom, and expanded it across the globe by dispersing the attributes of our classmates in different places. We hope that our maps helped our classmates feel a sense of togetherness during this time of isolation.
