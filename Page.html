    <p>Why we picked this project:
With Covid-19 having “alarming implications for individual and collective health and emotional and social functioning” (Pfefferbaum) we thought it important to try and connect with others in a fun and interactive way. Covid has been hard on a lot of people, and students are feeling the pressure and isolation. With virtual classes it became harder to interact with and get to know fellow students in class. For such reasons, our team decided to make a map that brought the class together in a virtual way. The hope for this map was that it could bring students together during a time when we were all isolated.

How we got the data:
To obtain the data used to make the project, we created a survey and distributed it amongst the class for people to answer. The questions asked were as follows:
Nickname/Alias
Where are you from?
What is your major?
Where do you currently live?
Where do you want to visit/travel to? (top three)
Where is your favorite place to spend time in Vancouver?
What is your favorite place or a place you find interesting/cool?
What is your favourite museum?
What is your favourite sports team and their city/state/province/country?
Your favorite hike or trail?
What countries have you visited/been too?
Additional Information
These questions were designed in order to help the class get to know about each other more by representing the answers to these questions cartographically.

Going through the data:
Once we had obtained a good number of responses, we began to go through the data. We grouped the data into three groups. The first being where people are from and where they live now. The second being points of interest like museums and favourite places. The third being countries people have been to and the ones they want to visit. When going through the data it was determined that while we asked about people’s favourite sports team, this data did not match as well with the categories we had created and so this data was left out of the final product.

Cartographic representation of the class:
The final product was the GEOB 472 class repressed cartographically. As many students have been feeling isolated during this pandemic (Laskowski) and most courses have been moved online, some students aren’t near their place of study. For this reason we thought it would be interesting to show where we are all from in this class (GOEB 472) and where we all are now.

Doing this showed how unique our class is since nobody who answered the survey was from the same place. All respondents were from different locations around the globe. All but two are currently in Vancouver however so it was interesting to see the flow of people in this class from where they started geographically to where they are now. (Maybe have some outside literature about flow maps?)

Our project highlights how unique our class is. It is interesting to think about how so many of us are from different places, have different interests, yet so many of us are all together right now taking GEOB 472, and how so many of us have come to the same place in the world at this moment in time (Vancouver BC). The data collected for this project shows where people are currently and their current interests. These are all variables that can change over time. Much of this project is temporary, and reflects the current state of things, but peoples locations and interests change, and people move around. Where they are living today might not even be where they live tomorrow. The only variable represented by this project that has a degree of permanence is where people are from. However, even this can be temporary as people's perceptions of where they are from can change over time and be based on how long they have spent in a location.
